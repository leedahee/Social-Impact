# Social-Impact
For successful implementation of innovation program and subsequent use of a facility in Flint area, I wanted to figure out estimated needs around that area. With assumption that people who are interested in technology, innovation, or entrepreneurship would join a certain group, which is biggest group at 'MeetUp' regarding those interests, I grabbed information about location of members and visualized the distribution of them.
